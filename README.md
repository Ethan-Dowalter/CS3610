# CS3610 - Data Structures
These are the notable assignments from CS3610 (Fall 2020)

This class further built understanding of object-oriented programming

This class is key in the OU curriculum, in that it is a prerequisite to pretty much all of the 4000 level (senior) computer science classes

It focused on concepts like binary trees, AVL trees, abstract data types, searching and sorting algorithms, analysis of those algorithms, and graphs
