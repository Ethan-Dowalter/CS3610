# CS3610 - Data Structures
These are the notable assignments from CS3610 (Fall 2020)

Course Description - 
Various data structures, algorithms associated with data structures, and analysis of algorithms are explored. Topics include analysis of algorithms, dynamic arrays, tree structures, heaps, balanced trees, dictionaries, graphs and graph algorithms, and the complexity of sorting. Graph algorithms for depth first and breadth first search, shortest path, minimum cost spanning trees, and others are covered. Coverage of built in data structures and algorithms in modern programming languages included.

This class further built understanding of object-oriented programming

This class is key in the OU curriculum, in that it is a prerequisite to pretty much all of the 4000 level (senior) computer science classes

It focused on concepts like binary trees, AVL trees, abstract data types, searching and sorting algorithms, analysis of those algorithms, and graphs
